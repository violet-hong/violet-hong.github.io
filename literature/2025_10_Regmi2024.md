## Abstract
Tirzepatide, a glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide/glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GIPR/GLP1R) agonist, has, in clinical trials, demonstrated greater reductions in glucose, body weight, and triglyceride levels compared with selective GLP-1R agonists in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, cellular mechanisms by which GIPR agonism may contribute to these improved efﬁcacy outcomes have not been fully deﬁned. Using human adipocyte and mouse models, we investigated how long-acting GIPR agonists regulate fasted and fed adipocyte functions. In functional assays, GIPR agonism enhanced insulin signaling, augmented glucose uptake, and increased the conversion of glucose to glycerol in a cooperative manner with insulin; however, in the absence of insulin, GIPR agonists increased lipolysis. In diet-induced obese mice treated with a long-acting GIPR agonist, circulating triglyceride levels were reduced during oral lipid challenge, and lipoprotein-derived fatty acid uptake into adipose tissue was increased. Our ﬁndings support a model for long-acting GIPR agonists to modulate both fasted and fed adipose tissue function differentially by cooperating with insulin to augment glucose and lipid clearance in the fed state while enhancing lipid release when insulin levels are reduced in the fasted state.

## Key Findings
- **GIPR is functionally expressed on human and mouse adipocytes**
    
- **Long-acting GIPR agonism enhances insulin-stimulated glucose uptake**
    
- **GIPR signaling biases glucose carbons toward glycerol rather than de novo lipogenesis**
    
- **Insulin presence switches GIPR output from lipolysis to storage**
    
- **Chronic GIPR agonism improves lipid clearance without increasing adiposity**
    
- **Fasted-state GIPR activation promotes lipolysis and lipid oxidation**

## Methods
-  Differentiated primary human adipocyte cultures
    
- Fluorescent ligand tracing in intact adipose tissue
    
- cAMP signaling assays for GPCR activation
    
- Radiolabeled glucose and fatty acid uptake assays
    
- Stable isotope tracing with NMR
    
- Hyperinsulinemic–euglycemic clamps
    
- In vivo oral lipid challenge and TRL particle uptake

## Notes
- **Demonstrates direct adipocyte-autonomous effects of GIPR signaling**
    
- **Reframes GIPR as a context-dependent metabolic switch**
    
- **Separates insulin secretion effects from adipocyte insulin action**
    
- **Provides a mechanistic explanation for superior lipid lowering with tirzepatide**
    
- **Adipose tissue acts as a regulated metabolic buffer rather than passive storage**

## Abstract
Generation of functionally mature organs requires exquisite control of transcriptional programs governing cell state transitions during development. Despite advances in understanding the behavior of adult intestinal stem cells and their progeny, the transcriptional regulators that control the emergence of the mature intestinal phenotype remain largely unknown. Using mouse fetal and adult small intestinal organoids, we uncover transcriptional differences between the fetal and adult state and identify rare adult-like cells present in fetal organoids. This suggests that fetal organoids have an inherent potential to mature, which is locked by a regulatory program. By implementing a CRISPR-Cas9 screen targeting transcriptional regulators expressed in fetal organoids, we establish Smarca4 and Smarcc1 as important factors safeguarding the immature progenitor state. Our approach demonstrates the utility of organoid models in the identification of factors regulating cell fate and state transitions during tissue maturation and reveals that SMARCA4 and SMARCC1 prevent precocious differentiation during intestinal development. Functional perturbation screen in intestinal organoids uncovers that SWI/SNF components safeguard tissue maturation.

## Key Findings
- Fetal intestinal organoids harbor **rare adult-like cells**, indicating latent maturation capacity.
    
- **CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screening** identifies **SMARCA4** and **SMARCC1** as repressors of epithelial maturation.
    
- Disruption of SMARCA4 or SMARCC1 reduces **fetal progenitor markers** and increases **adult secretory and tuft-like cells**.
    
- Loss of SMARCA4/SMARCC1 shifts chromatin accessibility toward an **adult-like epigenetic landscape**.
    
- SMARCA4/SMARCC1 maintain a **YAP1-driven fetal transcriptional program** that blocks maturation.

## Methods
- Targeted **CRISPR-Cas9 pooled screen** in fetal intestinal organoids.
    
- **Flow cytometry–based sorting** using SCA1 and CD117 as maturation markers.
    
- **Single-cell RNA-seq** to resolve cell-state transitions.
    
- **ATAC-seq** to assess chromatin accessibility changes.
    
- **In vivo transplantation** into adult mouse colon to test maturation competence.

## Notes
- Establishes **epigenetic repression**, not lack of competence, as a key barrier to fetal-to-adult transition.
    
- Positions **SWI/SNF chromatin remodelers** as gatekeepers of developmental timing.
    
- Demonstrates feasibility of **organoid-based genetic screens** for developmental regulators.
    
- Highlights **YAP1 activity** as a central node coupling mechanics, chromatin, and cell fate.

- Figure 5: Transcriptomic and chromatin remodeling toward adult state.
    
- Figure 6: Increased frequency of **adult-like tuft cells** upon SMARCA4/SMARCC1 loss.

## Limitations
- Genetic disruption does not fully recapitulate **complete adult epithelial maturation** in vitro.
    
- Lineage output biased toward **tuft cells**, not full secretory spectrum.
    
- Organoid culture conditions may constrain differentiation trajectories.
    
- SWI/SNF complex composition dynamics not directly dissected.

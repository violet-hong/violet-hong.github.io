## Abstract
In response to excessive DNA damage, human cells can activate p53 to induce apoptosis. Cells lacking p53 can still undergo apoptosis upon DNA damage, yet the responsible pathways are unknown. We observed that p53-independent apoptosis in response to DNA damage coincided with translation inhibition, which was characterized by ribosome stalling on rare leucine-encoding UUA codons and globally curtailed translation initiation. A genetic screen identified the transfer RNAse SLFN11 and the kinase GCN2 as factors required for UUA stalling and global translation inhibition, respectively. Stalled ribosomes activated a ribotoxic stress signal conveyed by the ribosome sensor ZAKα to the apoptosis machinery. These results provide an explanation for the frequent inactivation of SLFN11 in chemotherapy-unresponsive tumors and highlight ribosome stalling as a signaling event affecting cell fate in response to DNA damage.

            Editor’s summary
            
              Effective anticancer therapies cause DNA damage and kill cancer cells through a p53-dependent mechanism, but they can also kill cancer cells in which p53 is mutated. Boon
              et al
              . elucidated a pathway by which DNA damage can induce cell death in cells lacking p53. In cultured human cells, apoptosis induced by DNA damage occurred in cells with decreased translation. A genetic screen showed that this response required the transfer RNA endonuclease SLFN11, which is often found to be mutated in cancers unresponsive to chemotherapy. Activation of SLFN11 led to ribosome stalling, which then signaled initiation of apoptosis. —L. Bryan Ray

## Key Findings
- DNA damage induces **global translation inhibition** coupled to **codon-specific ribosome stalling**
    
- Ribosomes stall selectively at **rare leucine UUA codons**
    
- **SLFN11 nuclease activity** is required for UUA tRNA depletion and ribosome stalling
    
- **GCN2-mediated eIF2α phosphorylation** drives global translation shutdown
    
- **ZAKα senses stalled ribosomes**, activating **JNK-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis**
    
- Apoptosis occurs **independently of p53** and preferentially in low-translation cells
    
- SLFN11 loss uncouples DNA damage from translation inhibition and apoptosis

## Methods
- Puromycin incorporation as single-cell translation readout
    
- Haploid gene-trap mutagenesis screens for translation and apoptosis regulators
    
- Ribosome profiling with **Diricore codon occupancy analysis**
    
- Genetic knockouts and nuclease-dead SLFN11 rescue
    
- Patient-derived tumor organoids and primary human T cells

## Notes
- Reframes DNA damage response to include **ribosome-based signaling**
    
- Establishes **codon usage** as a stress-sensitive regulatory layer
    
- Separates **translation inhibition** from **apoptosis execution**
    
- Positions SLFN11 as a **molecular switch** between genotoxic stress and cell fate
    
- Explains SLFN11 loss as a mechanism of **chemotherapy resistance**

- Figure 4: ZAKα-mediated ribotoxic stress signaling to JNK
    
- Figure 5: Conservation of mechanism in tumor organoids and primary T cells

## Limitations
- Upstream sensing linking DNA lesions to SLFN11 activation unresolved
    
- Partial translation inhibition persists in some knockout contexts
    
- Limited exploration of non-cancer, non-genotoxic stress conditions

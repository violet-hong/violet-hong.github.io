## Abstract
Abstract
            
              The Wingless/Int-1 (WNT) signaling network is essential to orchestrate central physiological processes such as embryonic development and tissue homeostasis. In the currently held tenet, WNT/β-catenin signaling is initiated by WNT-induced recruitment of Frizzleds (FZDs) and LRP5/6 followed by the formation of a multiprotein signalosome complex. Here, we use bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) to show that different WNT paralogs dynamically trigger FZD-LRP6 association. While WNT-induced receptor interaction was independent of C-terminal LRP6 phosphorylation, it was allosterically modulated by binding of the phosphoprotein Dishevelled (DVL) to FZD. WNT-16B emerged as a ligand of particular interest, as it efficiently promoted FZD-LRP6 association but, unlike WNT-3A, did not lead to WNT/β-catenin signaling. Transcriptomic analysis further revealed distinct transcriptional fingerprints of WNT-3A and WNT-16B stimulation in HEK293 cells. Additionally, single-molecule tracking demonstrated that, despite increasing FZD5 and LRP6 confinement, WNT-16B stimulation did not result in formation of higher-order receptor clusters, in contrast to WNT-3A. Our results suggest that FZD-WNT-LRP5/6 complex formation alone is not sufficient for the initiation of WNT/β-catenin signaling. Instead, we propose a two-step model, where initial ligand-induced FZD-LRP6 association must be followed by receptor clustering into higher-order complexes and subsequent phosphorylation of LRP6 for efficient activation of WNT/β-catenin signaling.

## Key Findings
- **FZD–LRP6 association is ligand-induced but not sufficient** to initiate WNT/β-catenin signaling
    
- WNT-16B robustly induces **FZD–LRP6 binding** without β-catenin stabilization
    
- **Higher-order receptor clustering** correlates with signaling competence
    
- LRP6 **C-terminal phosphorylation occurs downstream** of clustering, not binding
    
- DVL binding **allosterically alters receptor geometry** without enforcing signaling

## Methods
- Direct **NanoBRET** assay to measure dynamic FZD–LRP6 association
    
- **Single-molecule TIRF tracking** to quantify confinement, interaction kinetics, and clustering
    
- **Photobleaching step analysis** to infer receptor stoichiometry
    
- **TOPFlash reporter assays** to isolate β-catenin–dependent output
    
- **Bulk RNA-seq** to compare ligand-specific transcriptional programs

## Notes
- Reframes WNT signaling as **multi-step spatial organization**, not binary receptor binding
    
- Demonstrates **ligand bias at the level of receptor nanoscale behavior**
    
- Separates **physical receptor engagement** from **signal competence**
    
- Undermines assumptions behind **WNT surrogate crosslinking strategies**

## Limitations

- Heavy reliance on **HEK293 and CHO cell models**
    
- Transcriptomic outputs may not reflect **physiological stem-cell contexts**
    
- Downstream determinants of **cluster maturation** remain undefined

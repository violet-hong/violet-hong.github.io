## Abstract
Colorectal cancers (CRCs) arise from precursor polyps whose cellular origins, molecular heterogeneity, and immunogenic potential may reveal diagnostic and therapeutic insights when analyzed at high resolution. Wepresent a single-cell transcriptomic and imaging atlas of the two most common human colorectal polyps,
conventional adenomas and serrated polyps, and their resulting CRC counterparts. Integrative analysis of 128 datasets from 62 participants reveals adenomas arise from WNT-driven expansion of stem cells, while serrated polyps derive from differentiated cells through gastric metaplasia. Metaplasia-associated damage is coupled to a cytotoxic immune microenvironment preceding hypermutation, driven partly by antigen-presentation differences associated with tumor cell-differentiation status. Microsatellite unstable CRCs contain distinct non-metaplastic regions where tumor cells acquire stem cell properties and cytotoxic immune cells are depleted. Our multi-omic atlas provides insights into malignant progression of colorectal polyps and their microenvironment, serving as a framework for precision surveillance and prevention of CRC.

## Key Findings
- **Adenomas** initiate via **WNT-driven stem cell expansion**
    
- **Serrated polyps** originate from **differentiated cells via gastric metaplasia**
    
- **Cytotoxic immune infiltration precedes hypermutation** in serrated lesions
    
- **Stem-like tumor cells suppress antigen presentation**
    
- Tumor **cell-of-origin dictates immune microenvironment**

## Methods
- Single-cell RNA sequencing of human polyps and CRCs
    
- SCENIC regulon-based cell state inference
    
- Multiplex IF/IHC for spatial immune mapping
    
- Genetically engineered mouse models (Apc vs Braf; stem vs non-stem origin)
    
- Functional antigen-presentation assays in organoids
## Notes
- **Tumorigenesis is cell-state–dependent**, not mutation-first
    
- Differentiated cells retain **immune-activating capacity**
    
- Acquisition of stemness correlates with **immune evasion**
    
- Precancer lesions encode future tumor immune behavior

- Figure 3: Spatial evidence for luminal surface origin of serrated lesions

## Limitations

- Limited mechanistic resolution of metaplasia triggers
    
- Partial immune compartment sampling

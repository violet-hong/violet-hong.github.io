## Abstract
We report that expression of the molecular motor Myosin 5b (MYO5B) and its folding chaperone unc-45 myosin chaperone A (UNC45A) is decreased in colorectal cancer. MYO5B downregulation is driven by promoter hypermethylation, whereas UNC45A protein loss results from posttranscriptional repression by upregulated microRNAs. These ﬁndings reveal a previously unrecognized MYO5B–UNC45A regulatory axis disrupted in colorectal cancer and highlights distinct epigenetic and post-transcriptional mechanisms contributing to disease progression.

## Key Findings
- **MYO5B mRNA and protein are consistently reduced** in human colorectal cancer samples across stages and subtypes
    
    [[Dooley2025]]
    
- **MYO5B downregulation is driven by promoter hypermethylation**, not by recurrent coding mutations
    
- **Pharmacologic DNA demethylation is sufficient** to restore MYO5B expression in CRC cell lines
    
- **UNC45A mRNA is unchanged**, but **UNC45A protein is reduced**, indicating post-transcriptional regulation
    
- **Multiple miRNAs targeting UNC45A are upregulated** in CRC tumors and cell lines
    
- **Inhibition of miR-296-3p increases UNC45A protein**, demonstrating causal miRNA-mediated repression
    
- Findings define a **disrupted MYO5B–UNC45A regulatory axis** in colorectal cancer

## Methods
- Integration of **TCGA, CPTAC, and public methylation databases**
    
- **DNA methylation profiling** of MYO5B promoter regions
    
- **Demethylation assays** using 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine
    
- **miRNA target prediction** combined with patient and cell line expression data
    
- **Human colonic organoids** as non-malignant epithelial controls
    
- **Immunofluorescence and proteomics** to assess protein abundance and localization
    
- **miRNA inhibition assays** to test causal post-transcriptional regulation

## Notes
- Establishes **epigenetic silencing of a vesicle trafficking motor** as a cancer-associated mechanism
    
- Separates **transcriptional control (MYO5B)** from **post-transcriptional control (UNC45A)**
    
- Highlights how **loss of a chaperone can phenocopy loss of its motor client**
    
- Frames epithelial polarity and trafficking machinery as **tumor suppressive systems**
    
- Provides a mechanistic bridge between **CRC biology and MVID-associated pathways**

## Figures / Data
- Figure 1: MYO5B expression is broadly reduced in CRC and correlates with survival
    
- Figure 2: MYO5B promoter hypermethylation and demethylation rescue
    
- Figure 3: Loss of MYO5B protein and apical localization in CRC tissue
    
- Figure 4: UNC45A protein reduction without mRNA change
    
- Figure 6–7: Upregulation of UNC45A-targeting miRNAs in CRC
    
- Figure 8: miR-296-3p inhibition restores UNC45A protein

## Limitations
- No in vivo CRC model directly testing MYO5B or UNC45A restoration
    
- Downstream effects of MYO5B loss on epithelial polarity not functionally dissected
    
- Relative contribution of individual miRNAs to UNC45A repression unresolved
    
- Tumor-suppressive function inferred largely from correlative human data

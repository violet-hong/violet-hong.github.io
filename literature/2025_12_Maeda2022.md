## Abstract
Polarized epithelial cells form the essential barrier against infection at mucosal surfaces. Many pathogens breach this barrier to cause disease, often by co-opting cellular endocytosis mechanisms to enter the cell through the lumenal (apical) cell surface. We recently discovered that loss of the cell polarity gene PARD6B selectively diminishes apical endosome function. Here, we find that in response to epithelial cell entry of certain viruses and bacterial toxins via the apical membrane, PARD6B and aPKC, two components of the PARD6B-aPKC-Cdc42 apical polarity complex undergo rapid proteasome-dependent degradation. Perturbation of apical membrane glycosphingolipids by toxin or virus binding signals to induce the degradation of PARD6B. The loss of PARD6B causes depletion of apical endosome function and renders the cell resistant to further infection from the lumenal cell surface - thus enabling a form of cell-autonomous host defense.
## Key Findings
- Apical exposure to **viruses or glycosphingolipid-binding toxins** induces rapid proteasome-dependent degradation of **PARD6B and aPKC**
    
- Loss of **PARD6B** is **necessary and sufficient** to suppress **apical endosome recycling and transcytosis**
    
- **Basolateral endosome pathways remain intact**, preserving epithelial barrier function
    
- **Cdc42 activation is required** for PARD6B degradation, but **not sufficient alone**
    
- Apical endosome suppression **blocks subsequent viral and toxin entry**, conferring **cell-autonomous protection**
    
- Protection is **restricted to apical infection routes**, not basolateral or phagocytic invasion
## Methods
- Human intestinal enteroid monolayers to model **physiologic epithelial polarity**
    
- FcRn-based **quantitative transcytosis and recycling assays** as a global readout of polarized endosome function
    
- Proteasome inhibition to establish **post-translational control**
    
- CRISPR and isoform-specific rescue to define **PARD6B specificity**
    
- Glycosphingolipid-binding toxin subunits to isolate **membrane sensing independent of infection**

## Notes
- Reframes epithelial polarity machinery as an **active innate immune sensor**
    
- Establishes the **apical endosome as a regulated defense node**, not a passive trafficking compartment
    
- Demonstrates that **epithelial defense can occur without cytokines or immune cells**
    
- Suggests **membrane lipid organization** as an upstream danger-sensing layer
    
- Links **diarrheal pathophysiology** to deliberate suppression of apical transport

## Figures / Data
- Figure 1: Selective loss of apical protein sorting and apical endosome function during viral exposure
    
- Figure 2–3: Proteasome-dependent degradation of PARD6B and aPKC from apical signaling
    
- Figure 4–5: Glycosphingolipid-binding toxins phenocopy viral effects without replication
    
- Figure 6: Cdc42 activation required for polarity complex degradation
    
- Figure 7: Functional protection against secondary infection via apical route

 ## Limitations
- Molecular sensor linking glycosphingolipid perturbation to Cdc42 activation is undefined
    
- Mechanism coupling Cdc42 activation to proteasomal targeting of PARD6B remains unclear
    
- Limited in vivo validation beyond ex vivo human tissue
    
- Specificity for which pathogens trigger this pathway is incompletely defined
- 
### **Critical Questions for Authors**

- What molecular adaptor connects apical membrane lipid perturbation to Cdc42 activation?
    
- Why is **PARD6B** uniquely targeted among Par6 isoforms?
    
- Is apical endosome suppression reversible, and on what timescale?
    
- How does this pathway interact with inflammatory signaling in vivo?
    

### **Open Gaps & Next Steps**

- Identify upstream **lipid or protein sensors** coupling membrane damage to polarity signaling
    
- Test pathway activation during **non-viral epithelial injury**
    
- Define long-term consequences of repeated apical endosome suppression
    
- Assess therapeutic modulation of this pathway in diarrheal disease

## Abstract
Differentiating stem cells must coordinate their metabolism and fate trajectories. Here, we report that the catalytic activity of the glycolytic enzyme Enolase 1 (ENO1) is directly regulated by RNAs leading to metabolic rewiring in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). We identify RNA ligands that speciﬁcally inhibit ENO1’s enzymatic activity in vitro and diminish glycolysis in cultured human cells and mESCs. Pharmacological inhibition or RNAi-mediated depletion of the protein deacetylase SIRT2 increases ENO1’s acetylation and enhances its RNA binding. Similarly, induction of mESC differentiation leads to increased ENO1 acetylation, enhanced RNA binding, and inhibition of glycolysis. Stem cells expressing mutant forms of ENO1 that escape or hyper-activate this regulation display impaired germ layer differentiation. Our ﬁndings uncover acetylationdriven riboregulation of ENO1 as a physiological mechanism of glycolytic control and of the regulation of stem cell differentiation. Riboregulation may represent a more widespread principle of biological control.

## Key Findings
- **ENO1 directly binds cellular mRNAs**, functioning as an RNA-binding enzyme
    
- **RNA binding inhibits ENO1 catalytic activity** by competing with substrate binding
    
- **Acetylation of ENO1 increases RNA binding**, reducing glycolytic flux
    
- **Differentiation increases ENO1 acetylation and RNA association**
    
- **RNA-sensitive ENO1 activity is required for proper germ layer differentiation**

## Methods
- eCLIP to map transcriptome-wide ENO1 RNA-binding sites
    
- In vitro ENO1 enzymatic assays with defined RNA ligands
    
- RNA proximity ligation assay to detect protein–RNA interactions in cells
    
- 13C-glucose tracing to assess metabolic flux downstream of ENO1
    
- CRISPR-based ENO1 mutant knock-in and auxin-inducible degradation

## Notes
- Establishes **RNA as a direct regulator of enzyme activity**, not just gene expression
    
- Introduces **riboregulation** as a physiological metabolic control mechanism
    
- Links **post-translational modification to RNA-mediated enzymatic control**
    
- Provides a mechanistic bridge between **metabolism and cell fate decisions**

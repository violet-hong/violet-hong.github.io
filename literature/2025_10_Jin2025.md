## Abstract
Microbiota-derived bile acids (BAs) are associated with host biology/disease, yet their causal effects remain largely undeﬁned. Herein, we speculate that characterizing previously undeﬁned microbiota-derived BAs would uncover previously unknown BA-sensing receptors and their biological functions. We integrated BA metabolomics and microbial genetics to functionally proﬁle >200 putative microbiota BA metabolic genes. We identiﬁed 56 less-characterized BAs, many of which are detected in humans/mammals. Notably, a subset of these BAs are potent antagonists of the human androgen receptor (hAR). They inhibit AR-related gene expression and are human-relevant. As a proof-of-principle, we demonstrate that one of these BAs suppresses tumor progression and potentiates the efﬁcacy of anti-PD-1 treatment in an AR-dependent manner. Our ﬁndings show that an approach combining bioinformatics, BA metabolomics, and microbial genetics can expand our knowledge of the microbiota metabolic potential and reveal an unexpected microbiota BA-AR interaction and its role in regulating host biology.

## Key Findings
- Microbiota-derived **oxo-bile acids directly antagonize androgen receptor (AR)** signaling.
    
- AR antagonism is **necessary** for tumor suppression and **sufficient** to potentiate anti-PD-1 therapy.
    
- Anti-tumor effects require **CD8⁺ T cell–intrinsic AR signaling**.
    
- AR-antagonizing bile acids promote **stem-like CD8⁺ T cell differentiation (Tcf7⁺, CD62L⁺)**.
    
- Effects are **immune-mediated**, not due to direct tumor cytotoxicity.

## Methods
- High-throughput **microbial hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSDH) functional screening**.
    
- Targeted and untargeted **bile acid metabolomics (LC-MS)**.
    
- **AR luciferase reporter** and ligand-binding assays.
    
- **Syngeneic murine tumor models** with androgen manipulation.
    
- **CD8⁺ T cell depletion and adoptive transfer** experiments.
    
- **Single-cell RNA-seq** of tumor-infiltrating CD8⁺ T cells.

## Notes
- Demonstrates **microbiota metabolites as functional steroid receptor ligands**, not passive correlates.
    
- Reframes bile acids as **immune-reprogramming signals**, not only metabolic detergents.
    
- Connects **sex hormone signaling** directly to **tumor immunotherapy efficacy**.
    
- Provides a mechanistic bridge between **microbiome variability** and **heterogeneous immunotherapy response**.

## Figures / Data
- **Figure 1–2**: Functional mapping of microbiota HSDHs and novel bile acid structures.
    
- **Figure 3**: Structure–activity relationship defining AR antagonism by oxo-bile acids.
    
- **Figure 4**: Microbiota-dependent production and human relevance of AR-antagonizing bile acids.
    
- **Figure 5**: Tumor suppression and anti-PD-1 potentiation in vivo.
    
- **Figure 6–7**: CD8⁺ T cell–intrinsic AR requirement and stem-like differentiation trajectory.

## Limitations
- Molecular details of **AR–bile acid binding dynamics** remain incomplete.
    
- Limited direct **human interventional validation**.
    
- Specificity across different bile acid species requires further resolution.

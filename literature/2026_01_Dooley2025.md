## Abstract
BACKGROUND & AIMS: The xenobiotic efflux pump P-glycoprotein is highly expressed on the apical membrane of the gastrointestinal tract, where it regulates the levels of intracellular substrates. P-glycoprotein is altered in disease, but the mechanisms that regulate the levels of P-glycoprotein are still being explored. The molecular motor myosin Vb (Myo5b) traffics diverse cargo to the apical membrane of intestinal epithelial cells. We hypothesized that Myo5b was responsible for the delivery of P-glycoprotein to the apical membrane of enterocytes. 
METHODS: We used multiple murine models that lack functional Myo5b or the myosin binding partner Rab11a to analyze P-glycoprotein localization. Pig and human tissue were analyzed to determine P-glycoprotein localization in the setting of MYO5B mutations. Intestinal organoids were used to examine P-glycoprotein trafficking and to assay P-glycoprotein function when MYO5 is inhibited.
RESULTS: In  mice lacking Myo5b or the binding partner Rab11a, P-glycoprotein was improperly trafficked and had decreased presence in the brush border of enterocytes. Immunostaining of a pig model lacking functional Myo5b and human biopsies from a patient with an inactivating mutation in Myo5b also showed altered localization of intestinal P-glycoprotein. Human intestinal organoids expressing the motorless MYO5B tail domain had colocalization with P-glycoprotein, confirming that P-glycoprotein was trafficked by MYO5B in human enterocytes. Inhibition of MYO5 in human intestinal cell lines and organoids resulted in decreased P-glycoprotein capacity. Additionally, inhibition of MYO5 in human colon cancer cells diminished P-glycoprotein activity and increased cell death in response to a chemotherapeutic drug. 
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these data demonstrate that Myo5b is necessary for the apical delivery of P-glycoprotein.
## Key Findings
- **MYO5B is necessary for apical localization of P-glycoprotein** in enterocytes in vivo and in vitro
    
- **Rab11a-positive recycling vesicles mediate transporter delivery**
    
- Loss of MYO5B causes **subapical retention and functional loss** of P-glycoprotein
    
- **MYO5 inhibition reduces xenobiotic efflux capacity** without broadly disrupting viability
    
- Not all ABC transporters share this dependency (e.g., **ABCG2 is MYO5B-independent**)

## Methods
- Germline and inducible **intestinal-specific Myo5b knockout mice**
    
- **Rab11a and Rab8a deletion models**
    
- Human and murine **intestinal organoids (3D + ALI monolayers)**
    
- **Motorless MYO5B-tail cargo-trapping strategy**
    
- **Rhodamine-123 efflux assays** for transporter function
    
- MYO5 inhibition using **MyoVin-1**

## Notes
- Establishes **motor-based trafficking**, not transcription, as a limiting step for efflux capacity
    
- Reframes MYO5B as a **gatekeeper of epithelial chemical defense**
    
- Provides mechanistic separation between **brush-border structure vs transporter delivery**
    
- Connects **MVID, IBD, and cancer drug resistance** through a shared trafficking axis

## Limitations

- Long-term **in vivo pharmacologic targeting** not tested
    
- Functional consequences of **partial mislocalization** remain unclear

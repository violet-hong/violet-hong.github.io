## Abstract
Improving Whole-Genome Screens
Improved methods are needed for the knockout of individual genes in genome-scale functional screens.Wang et al.(p.80, published online 12 December) and Shalem et al.(p.84, published online 12 December) used the bacterial CRISPR/Cas9 system to power-screen protocols that avoid several of the pitfalls associated with small interfering RNA (siRNA) screens. Genome editing by these methods completely disrupts target genes, thus avoiding weak signals that can occur when transcript abundance is partially decreased by siRNA. Furthermore, gene targeting by the CRISPR system is more precise and appears to produce substantially fewer off-target effects than existing methods., Genome-editing technology allows improved positive or negative selection screens.

The simplicity of programming the CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)–associated nuclease Cas9 to modify specific genomic loci suggests a new way to interrogate gene function on a genome-wide scale. We show that lentiviral delivery of a genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout (GeCKO) library targeting 18,080 genes with 64,751 unique guide sequences enables both negative and positive selection screening in human cells. First, we used the GeCKO library to identify genes essential for cell viability in cancer and pluripotent stem cells. Next, in a melanoma model, we screened for genes whose loss is involved in resistance to vemurafenib, a therapeutic RAF inhibitor. Our highest-ranking candidates include previously validated genes NF1 and MED12, as well as novel hits NF2, CUL3, TADA2B, and TADA1. We observe a high level of consistency between independent guide RNAs targeting the same gene and a high rate of hit confirmation, demonstrating the promise of genome-scale screening with Cas9.

## Key Findings
- **CRISPR–Cas9** enables efficient genome-scale loss-of-function screening in human cells
    
- DNA-level knockout yields stronger phenotypes than partial knockdown approaches
    
- Negative selection screens recover core **essential gene programs**
    
- Positive selection identifies genes whose loss confers **drug resistance**
    
- High concordance across independent sgRNAs supports causal inference

## Methods
- Lentiviral delivery of **Cas9 + sgRNA** in a single vector
    
- Pooled sgRNA libraries targeting constitutive exons
    
- Low-MOI transduction to ensure single perturbations per cell
    
- Deep sequencing of sgRNA abundance for phenotype inference
    
- GSEA and RIGER-based hit ranking

## Notes
- Establishes **CRISPR screening** as a replacement for RNAi in mammalian cells
    
- Reframes functional genomics around **complete gene inactivation**
    
- Demonstrates scalability to diverse phenotypes beyond viability
    
- Introduces selection logic transferable to many disease contexts

# Research

I am interested in uncovering the cellular mechanisms that underlie gastrointestinal diseases characterized by functional and structural dysregulation. My work examines how perturbations in epithelial architecture, intracellular trafficking, and neuro-epithelial signaling impair gut physiology, using mechanistic models to bridge basic cell biology with clinically relevant disease states.

## Literature Notes

Structured breakdown of papers that I read and are crucial to my studies.
These notes aim to establish conceptual integration by deep-diving into individual articles.

## Protocols & Methods

Experimentally validated protocols and methodological notes developed or
adapted during my research training.
